### 🕵️‍♂️ About Me

- 🔒 Cyber Security Researcher with hands-on experience in **VAPT** (Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing) and **Red Teaming** adventures.
- 💙 Blue Team fan in training, working my way to be a **SOC L1 Analyst**.
- ⚡️ I love automating security audits (because who likes repetitive work? Not me!).
- 🤹‍♂️ 5+ automation projects and counting—yes, my scripts have scripts!
- 🏆 Placed **50th** out of 3600+ teams at the **NPIIC Pentathon CTF-2025**—proof that caffeine and curiosity are a powerful combo.
- 😄 I break things (ethically), then help fix them better.
